# almusicbot

I participate in a [Discord] server that has a music channel where people post links to YouTube videos. I thought it would be nice if we had a bot that listened for links and added people's recommendations to a daily playlist.

It's written in Ruby and uses [Discordrb] to interact with the Discord APIs.
